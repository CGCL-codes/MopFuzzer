Possible values are: adaptive - adapt to maintain the given amount of free heap at all times  even during the GC cycle; static -  trigger GC when free heap falls below the threshold; aggressive - run GC continuously  try to evacuate everything; compact - run GC more frequently and with deeper targets to free up more memory."
