Usage:
         jtreg options... tests...

Tests can be given as files or folders containing test files, or by means of
test groups. Long lists of options and tests may be encapsulated in "at-files".


Verbose Options
                These options control the amount of output written to the
                console while running tests

    -v | --v:<value> | -verbose | --verbose:<value>
                    Increase the amount of output written to the console. A
                    value, or selected combinations of values separated by
                    commas, may be given to select the type of output desired.
        default         Three lines of output per test: start, end, status
        summary         One line of output per test: status, test name
        all             Selected contents of JTR file for all tests (includes
                        stdout/stderr)
        pass            Selected contents of JTR file for passed tests
        fail            Selected contents of JTR file for failed tests
        error           Selected contents of JTR file for errored tests
        nopass          Suppress output for tests that passed
        time            Elapsed time per action
        multirun        Updates for each testsuite when tests from more than one
                        are being executed.
    -v1             Short for -verbose:summary
    -va             Short for -verbose:all
    -ve             Short for -verbose:error
    -vf             Short for -verbose:fail
    -vp             Short for -verbose:pass
    -vt             Short for -verbose:time

                    Specify additional environment variables to be passed to
                    each test. If a value is not given for a name, the current
                    value of the environment variable will be used. Standard
                    environment variables, like DISPLAY, LANG, windir,
                    SystemRoot, etc, will automatically be given to each test,
                    if they are set in the current environment.
    -g | -gui       Access regression extensions via the standard JavaTest
                    harness gui
    -ignore:<value>
                    Specify how to handle tests containing an @ignore tag.
        quiet           Completely ignore such tests.
        error           (Default.) Execute the actions up to the @ignore tag,
                        then give an "Error" result.
        run             Run the test, as though the @ignore tag were not
                        present.
    -l | -listtests
                    List the tests that would be executed instead of executing
                    them.
    -lock:<file>    Lock file to use for tests in "exclusive access" directories
                    when running tests in multiple concurrent instances of
                    jtreg.
    -nativepath:<path>
                    Path to location of native libraries and programs needed by
                    the tests.
    -noignore       suppress the effect of any @ignore tags, allowing the test
                    to proceed as if the @ignore tags were not present.
                    Deprecated: see the -ignore option.
    -nr | -noreport
                    Do not generate a final report.
    -o:<classname> | -observer:<classname>
                    Specifies the class to observe the progress of a test suite;
                    the class must implement a specific interface; contact a
                    developer for details. For example,
                    -o:SampleRegressionObserver
    -od:<path> | -observerDir:<path> | -op:<path> | -observerPath:<path>
                    Specifies the pathname of a directory or .jar file in which
                    the observer class is located. The given pathname is simply
                    appended to the CLASSPATH used for the tests, thus care
                    should be taken when naming an observer not to collide with
                    the names of classes internal to the JavaTest harness or the
                    JRE. For example, put the observer class in its own named
                    package.
    -r:<directory> | -reportDir:<directory>
                    All report files placed here; "./JTreport" is default
    -report:<value>
                    Configure the report generated after tests are run.
        none            Do not generate a report; equivalent to -noreport.
        executed        Include tests executed in the latest run
        files           Include all tests specified by groups and paths on the
                        command line, ignoring filters like status, exclude
                        lists, and keywords.
        all-executed    Include all tests that have been executed in current
                        work directory
        all             Include all tests that are present in the test suite,
                        whether they have been executed
    -retain | --retain:<none,lastRun,pass,fail,error,all,file-pattern>,...
                    Specify files to be retained after each test completes
                    executing. If -retain is not specified or is specified with
                    lastRun, only the files from the last test executed will be
                    retained, in the test's scratch directory. For all other
                    uses of -retain, files will be retained in a test-specific
                    directory in the work-directory. If -retain is specified
                    with no argument, all files will be retained. Otherwise, the
                    files may be described by one or more of the following
                    values:
        none            Do not retain any of the files generated by each test
        lastRun         Retain files generated by the last test that was run
                        (default)
        pass            Retain files generated by tests that pass
        fail            Retain files generated by tests that fail
        error           Retain files generated by tests that caused an error
        all             Retain all files generated by each test
        file-pattern    Retain files that match a specific filename. The name
                        may contain '*' to match any sequence of characters. For
                        example, result.* or *.err.
    -ro | -reportOnly
                    Generate report for previously executed tests. This does not
                    re-run any tests. A work directory containing the results of
                    the executed tests must be provided. The default location is
                    "./JTwork". To specify an alternate directory, use -workDir.
    -show:[<section-name>/]<stream-name>
                    Show the contents of a stream in a specific section or in
                    all sections of the results file for a test. The content is
                    shown as originally written to the stream: that is, without
                    the escape encoding used in the .jtr file. If no section
                    name is given, the output for the named stream in all
                    sections is shown.
                    For example, -show:rerun -show:main/System.out
    -showGroups     Show the expansion (to files and directories) of the groups
                    given on the command line. To see the expansion of all the
                    groups in a test suite, specify the name of the test suite.
    -startHttpd     Start the http server to view test results
    -ttf:<classname> | -testThreadFactory:<classname>
                    Specifies the class to create thread factory for test
                    execution. The class should implement the
                    java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory interface.
    -ttfp:<path> | -testThreadFactoryPath:<path>
                    Specifies classspath for custom test thread factory
                    implementation. The classes from this classpath are loaded
                    by tested JDK only using URLClassLoader.
    -w:<directory> | -workDir:<directory>
                    Location for .class files, .jtr files, etc. "./JTwork" is
                    default
    -wsl            (Windows only) Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to
                    run shell tests
    -xml | --xml:verify
                    Create ant/junit xml files into the workDir. Optionally
                    verify if the file is well-formed.

Timeout Options
                These options control the behavior when tests run longer than
                their specified timeout value.
    -th:<classname> | -timeoutHandler:<classname>
                    Specifies the class to handle timeouts. The class must
                    extend com.sun.javatest.regtest.TimeoutHandler. For example,
                    -th:MyHandler
    -thd:<path> | -timeoutHandlerDir:<path>
                    Specifies the pathname of a directory or .jar file in which
                    the timeout handler class is located. The given pathname is
                    simply appended to the CLASSPATH used for the tests, thus
                    care should be taken when naming a timeout handler not to
                    collide with the names of classes internal to the JavaTest
                    harness or the JRE. For example, put the timeout handler
                    class in its own named package.
    -thtimeout:<#seconds> | -timeoutHandlerTimeout:<#seconds>
                    Specifies execution time limitation for the timeout handler.
                    If the timeout handler does not finish its actions within
                    the specified period of time, it will be interrupted.
                    Non-positive values mean no limitation. The default value is
                    5 minutes (300 seconds).
    -timeout:<number> | -timeoutFactor:<number>
                    A scaling factor to extend the default timeout of all tests.
                    Typically used when running tests on slow systems or systems
                    with slow file systems.
    -tl:<#seconds> | -timelimit:<#seconds>
                    Do not run tests which specify a timeout longer than a given
                    value. The comparison is done against any values specified
                    in the test, before any timeout factor is applied.

Agent Pool Options
                Options to configure the size of the pool of VMs used to execute
                tests in agent mode.
    --max-pool-size <number>
                    The maximum number of VMs to keep available in the agent
                    pool. The default is either 2x the concurrency.
    --pool-idle-timeout <number>
                    The time, in seconds, before an idle VM in the pool is
                    automatically closed.

Test Selection Options
                These options can be used to refine the set of tests to be
                executed.

    -a | -automatic | -automagic
                    Any test with /manual will not be run
    -bug:<bugid>    Run only those tests which apply to the given bugid.
    -exclude:<file> | -Xexclude:<file>
                    Provide a file specifying tests that should not be run
    -k:<keywordExpr> | -keywords:<keywordExpr>
                    A keyword boolean expression for test selection. The
                    expression can contain keyword names, combined with & (and),
                    | (or), ! (not) and parentheses.
    -m | -manual    Only tests with /manual will be run
    -match:<file>   Provide a file specifying tests that can be run (inverse of
                    -exclude)
    -noshell        Any tests which contain shell actions will not be run
    -shell          Only tests which contain shell actions will be run
    -status:<value>,...
                    Select tests according to their result in an earlier run.
                    The value can be one or more of the following values,
                    separated by commas.
        pass            Tests that passed
        fail            Tests that failed
        notRun          Tests that have not been run
        error           Tests that could not be run because of errors, or tests
                        that were ignored

Test Mode Options
                Each test consists of a series of steps, called actions. The
                jtreg harness provides different modes, which determine the JVM
                to use to execute each action. The default is to run each action
                in a new JVM.

    -avm | -agentvm | -s | -svm | -samevm
                    Execute each action using a pool of reusable JVMs, except
                    when an action specifies otherwise. It provides good
                    performance, and reasonable isolation between actions: if a
                    JVM can be reset to a standard state after it has been used,
                    it will be returned to the pool for reuse; otherwise, it
                    will be discarded and replaced if and when necessary. This
                    mode is generally recommended for all use.
                    The JDK to use can be specified with -testjdk or -jdk,
                    except for @compile actions, which use -compilejdk or -jdk.
                    If values are not provided, the environment variable
                    JAVA_HOME is used.
    -ovm | -othervm
                    Execute every action in a new JVM. This is the default. It
                    provides the maximum isolation between actions, at a
                    significant cost in performance.
                    The JDK to use can be specified with -testjdk or -jdk,
                    except for @compile actions, which use -compilejdk or -jdk.
                    If values are not provided, the environment variable
                    JAVA_HOME is used.

JDK-related Options
                By default, tests will be run using the default JVM in the test
                JDK. You can pass all applicable JVM options via using
                -vmoption; in addition, many common JVM options are also
                supported directly. For full details of any option, consult the
                documentation for that version of the JDK, or try using "java
                -help" or "java -X". If an option is not applicable to a
                particular platform or JDK release, it will be rejected.

    --add-modules <module>(,<module>)*
                    root modules to resolve in addition to the initial module
    -agentlib:<libname><[=<options>]
                    Load native agent library
    -agentpath:<pathname><[=<options>]
                    Load native agent library by full pathname
    -classic | -green | -native | -hotspot | -client | -server | -d32 | -d64
                    VM Options
    -compilejdk:<java.home>
                    Compile all tests using specified JDK. If not specified,
                    tests are compiled with the JDK used to run the tests. See
                    also -jdk. For example,
                    -jdk:/usr/local/java/jdk1.5/solaris-sparc
    -cpa:<path> | -classpathappend:<path>
                    Append the provided classPath to the CLASSPATH of every
                    test. This is designed to be used primarily for tests which
                    require non-core JDK functionality. For example, to test
                    Swing, which is not part of core JDK1.1, the following
                    addition to the CLASSPATH would be necessary:
                    -cpa:/usr/local/java/swing-1.0.3/swingall.jar
    -D<name>=<value>
                    Define a system property
    -debug:<option>...
                    Use this to specify VM options to attach a debugger to a VM
                    running a test. It is similar to -vmoptions except that it
                    is not used when starting VMs used to query the properties
                    of that VM. Any timeout for a test is automatically disabled
                    when this option is used. See also -javaoptions and
                    -vmoptions.
    -enableassertions | --enableassertions:* | -ea | --ea:* | -disableassertions
    | --disableassertions:* | -da | --da:*
                    Enable or disable assertions
    -enablesystemassertions | -esa | -disablesystemassertions | -dsa
                    Enable or disable system assertions
    -javaagent:<jarpath><[=<options>]
                    Load Java programming language agent
    -javacoption:<option>
                    Additional compiler option. You can give this option
                    multiple times. Any embedded filenames must be given with
                    absolute paths.
    -javacoptions:<option>...
                    Additional compiler options. You can give this option
                    multiple times, or give many values together, separated by
                    spaces. If you give multiple values, you may need to enclose
                    them in quotes, depending on the shell you use. Any embedded
                    filenames must be given with absolute paths. Warning: do not
                    use this form if any of the options has an argument such as
                    a filename that might contain spaces. In that case, use one
                    or more -javacoption options instead.
    -javaoption:<option>
                    Additional java option for running test classes. You can
                    give this option multiple times. Any embedded filenames must
                    be given with absolute paths. See also -vmoption.
    -javaoptions:<option>...
                    Additional java options for running test classes. You can
                    give this option multiple times, or give many values
                    together, separated by spaces. If you give multiple values,
                    you may need to enclose them in quotes, depending on the
                    shell you use. Any embedded filenames must be given with
                    absolute paths. Warning: do not use this form if any of the
                    options has an argument such as a filename that might
                    contain spaces. In that case, use one or more -javaoption
                    options instead. See also -vmoptions.
    -jdk:<java.home> | -testjdk:<java.home>
                    Run all tests using specified JDK. For example,
                    -jdk:/usr/local/java/jdk1.5/solaris-sparc
    -jit            Enable the JIT for the tests. The JIT is turned on by
                    default.
    --limit-modules <module>(,<module>)*
                    limit the universe of observable modules
    -nojit          Disable the JIT for the tests.
    --patch-module <module>=<path>
                    Specify classes to override module classes
    -vmoption:<option>
                    Any other VM option. You can give this option multiple
                    times. Any embedded filenames must be given with absolute
                    paths. This option will be used when compiling and running
                    classes. See also -javaoption.
    -vmoptions:<option>...
                    Any other VM options. You can give this option multiple
                    times, or give many values together, separated by spaces. If
                    you give multiple values, you may need to enclose them in
                    quotes, depending on the shell you use. Any embedded
                    filenames must be given with absolute paths. Warning: do not
                    use this form if any of the options has an argument such as
                    a filename that might contain spaces. In that case, use one
                    or more -vmption options instead. This option will be used
                    when compiling and running classes. See also -javaoptions.

    Tests           Specifying collections of tests.

        at-files        Long lists of options and tests may be encapsulated in
                        "at-files". Place the options and/or tests in a file and
                        specify the name of the file on the command line with
                        @file. Options or tests that include white space should
                        be enclosed within either single or double quote
                        characters. Comments may be included in the file by
                        prefixing them with '#'. To specify an option beginning
                        with '@' on the command line, use "@@" to avoid @file
                        expansion.

    Tests           Specifying collections of tests.

        Groups          A test suite may define named groups of tests. To
                        specify the name of a group of tests on the command
                        line, use test-suite-dir:group-name, where
                        test-suite-dir is a path to the root directory of the
                        test suite (that is, the directory containing the
                        TEST.ROOT file), and where group-name is the name of the
                        group of tests defined in the test suite. If
                        test-suite-dir is omitted it defaults to the value of
                        the -dir option, if given, or to the current directory
                        otherwise.
                        (Note: on Windows, to avoid confusion with absolute path
                        names including a drive specifier, the test-suite-dir
                        must not be specified with a relative path consisting of
                        a single letter.)

                        Groups are defined in a test suite using one or more
                        Java properties files. The names of these files must be
                        listed in the "groups" entry in TEST.ROOT. If the
                        filename is enclosed in square brackets, no error
                        message will be given if the file cannot be found.
                        Within the property files, each entry specifies items to
                        be included or excluded from the group. To include a
                        test or directory of tests, simply specify the name of
                        the test or directory. To exclude a test or directory of
                        tests, use '-' followed by the name of the test or
                        directory. To include the contents of another group, use
                        ':' followed by the name of the group. There must be no
                        spaces between the "-" or ":" and the name that follows.
    Summary         The following kinds of arguments can be used to specify
                    tests to be executed.In these examples, square brackets are
                    used to indicate optional parts.
        directory       All tests found in and under the given directory.
        file[#id][?string]
                        Either all tests in the given file if no id is given, or
                        the specified test if an id is given. A file contains
                        multiple tests if there are multiple test descriptions,
                        in separate comment blocks.
                        If '?string' is specified, the string will be passed to
                        the test so that it may filter the parts of the test to
                        be executed. The string will typically be the name of a
                        method to be executed.
                        If conflicting values for the string are given for a
                        specific test, the last one given will be used.
        [path]:group-name
                        A group of tests, as defined in the TEST.groups file in
                        the testsuite root directory. If given, path specifies
                        the testsuite root directory. If not given, it defaults
                        to the one enclosing the current directory.
        @file           A file containing values to be treated as if on the
                        command-line.
